### Purpose 

This is a basic API for a database for logging novel tomato varieties bred and propagated by university students around the world. 
Every year we have new varieties of tomato that get bred in academic institutions. We at University of X need a centralized database for students of natural sciences all around the world to log and document novel tomato varieties.

### Technologies_Used
 
 MERN, Javascript, dotenv, jest, supertest, morgan, artillery 
 VS Code, Postman, GitHub, Trello, ERD Charts

### Technical_Challenges 

The programmer unwittingly created another application in the server.js file, which essentially blocked Postman from accessing the routes. After some time spent debugging, the programmer discovered they had to delete and rearrange just a few lines in the server.js to make a proper connection between the app.js and server.js files. 

### How to Run 

- Open terminal on computer
